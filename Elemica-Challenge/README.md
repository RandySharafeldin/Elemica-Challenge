# ElemicaChallenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.5.

## Run Instructions
Simply navigate into the project directory and with both angular and angular material installed run `npm install` followed by `ng serve` and the page should be visible at `localhost:4200`!

## Design
The main component displayed is the `purchase-confirmation-card`, this component encapsulates the others and contains the logic for the messages displayed when the submit button is clicked. I did my best to make sure the page looks good on any sized monitor and avoid angular stlye issues like crowding the `app.component` files and using inline styles.\

Thank you again for this oppportunity and I look forward to hearing your feedback!
